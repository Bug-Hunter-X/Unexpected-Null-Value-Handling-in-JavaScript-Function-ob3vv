# Unexpected Null Value Handling in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: failing to handle `null` values appropriately. The `foo` function in `bug.js` showcases a correct implementation, while a potential incorrect version (which would lead to errors if null values are passed) might be included in future updates.  This is a simple illustration to highlight the importance of explicit null checks to prevent unexpected application behavior or crashes.
